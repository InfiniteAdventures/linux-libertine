-------Generating font files from SFDs --------------- 
We do not recommend to generate font files yourself. Font files are no compiled programs and so there is no real need to "compile" fonts from the "sources". But if you really want to do so, because you eventually made some changes, then you should follow these guidelines:

-You should have the latest fontforge-version installed:
http://fontforge.sf.net

-You can generate different font formats from the SFDs, recently the source file is configured to make OTFs or Type1 in the first place. So doing a "generate fonts | OpenType (CFF)" from the SFD is the easiest way to make a font.

-If you want to generate TTFs you have to take the following steps:
   1) skale the EM to 2048
   2) delete the "O"s from the fontnames
   3) Round kontours to integer
   4) change to quadratic splines
   5) do a "Hint | Auto Instruct"
   6) generate TTF (with following options)
         TrueType Hints
         PS Glyph names
         OpenType
            Dummy 'DSIG'

Once again, I want to ask you not to generate the fonts yourself if you never heard of the words "hinting/instructing", "EM" or "quadratic splines". You are taking the best way if you are choosing our fonts and send us a report if you need some changes.
